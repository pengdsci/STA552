# Data Selection Criteria
Choose a dataset different from the one used in Project #1 but meeting the same criteria:

* The i.i.d. sample dataset should contain at least **1,000 records**.

* It should have at least **10 feature variables** in addition to the response variable(s).

* The feature variables should be a mix of **categorical and numerical data**.

* The dataset should include both **continuous and binary response variables** to enable meaningful regression modeling.

* <font color = "red">This dataset will also be used in the second part of the project #2, which focuses on **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.</font>



# Analytic Components

The report should follow the format specified in Project #1 and be well-structured with:

## 1. Introduction

* Provide context for the analysis.
* State the purpose and objectives of the study.

## 2. Data Preparation

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarize and visualize key characteristics of the dataset.

* **Imputation (if necessary)**: Use multiple imputation techniques for handling missing values.

* **Feature Engineering**: Transform or create new variables to improve model performance.

## 3. Regularized Linear regression

Perform three types of regularized regression:

* **LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net**

* Conduct **coefficient path analysis** to examine variable selection trends.

* Apply **cross-validation** to determine the optimal regularization parameter.

* Finalize the **recommended model** and provide its explicit mathematical expression.


## 4. Regularized Logistic Regression

* Extend the above regularized linear regression approach to logistic regression.

* Use ROC analysis to assess model performance and select the final logistic regression model.


# Project Reporting and Writing


## 1. Reporting Key Information

The report should follow the format specified in Project #1 and be well-structured with:

### 1.1. Opening Paragraph in Each Section (Subsection)

Opening Paragraph in Each Section (Subsection)

* Begin with a concise description of the purpose of the analysis.

* Clearly state:
  + **What was analyzed?** (e.g., dataset, model, experiment)
  + **How was it analyzed?** (e.g., methods, tools, techniques used
  
### 1.2. Present the Results Clearly 

* Highlight key findings using tables, charts, and graphs where applicable.
* Ensure visuals include:
  + **Clear titles and captions**
  + **Labeled axes, legends, and annotations** for easy interpretation
  
  
### 1.3. Justify the Results with Interpretation

* Explain the significance of trends or patterns.
* Support findings with **statistical evidence or theoretical explanations**.

### 1.4. Address Limitations and Alternative Explanations

* Discuss factors that might influence results.
* Acknowledge **uncertainties, assumptions, or possible biases**.
* Suggest **areas for future investigation**.


### 1.5. Conclude with Key Insights & Implications

* Summarize findings and their practical applications.
* Provide **recommendations based on results**.


## 2. Best Practices

Follow these best practices to ensure clarity and rigor:

* **Use precise language** – Avoid vague terms; be specific.
* **Support claims with data** – Use statistical evidence and references.
* **Use visual aids effectively** – Enhance, rather than replace, explanations.
* **Maintain logical flow** – Present findings in a structured and sequential manner.
* **Address counterpoints** – Discuss alternative explanations and potential limitations.
